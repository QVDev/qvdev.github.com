<p><b>6.37pm Introduction</b></p>
From here I will be posting live progress of the ordr.in API hack. I will be creating an Android application that make
use of the ordr.in API. The aim for the end of the hacking session will be successfully placing an order on Sandbox.
The UI will be simple and it will be just used to see if the API is any good and how far I can come during this session.
<br>
<br><b>Steps to achieve goal, when needed I will update</b><br>
