<h1>Don't use Snapchat</h1>
For the following reasons:(I keep it short):
1. Deleted content from a drive, your own or a friends, whoever, it can be restored. This is what forensic people do.(Don't hate forencsic people they restore data of Pedofilie people or other suspects)
2. You want to be a victim of stupidity?
3. If you are not crazy, just vist you're boy/girl friend if you want to share intimate moments.
even if you are living in separate cities, a ticket is much cheaper then being naked on the internet forever.

If this is not enough to stop you to use a stupid service like snapchat, then it is you're own fault. 
But dont be surprised if you're pictures end up public on the internet!

This is just my small note for people who trust services like this. I am not an expert and not interested in
you're pictures. But as a developer I know what is posible. So believe a company or just me.

Have a good night!!!
