To make sure you're code is good quality there are several static anaylyzers out there you can make use of. 
In this post I will highlight the most popular ones. I will show you how to configure them for you're Android
project that make use of the Gradle build system. On the internet I could not found alot about how to
configure this, so I thought it might be usefull to share this with other developers.
