Monday Bendle.nl has been launched. And I just noticed that today after watching
television. The idea is nice, but I was wondering myself how they
put the website together and how safe is it?. Here I will explain a bit.<br><br>
<!-- more start -->
<b>So lets start:</b><br>
I visited the website with the Chrome inspector and to my big surprise I could
see JSON responses flying around. For a moment I wanted to have a look if I could
get the data for free. But ended up not doing that, because I am not an
security expert. <br><br>
What I end up doing was creating a little Android application that basically fetches
the JSON response and build on that the application. So I started programming away.
After a few hours, roughly takend from 9pm-3am I builded the home screen of the
website into the application. I put it here for download so you can have a look.
<br><br>
I used some basic tools to find myself a simple an small project for the night.
<br>I used the Google Chrome inspector.
<br>Also used Advanced Rest Client Chrome app.
<br>And of course Android studio.
<br>
<br>
So now lets hope I dont waste for now any more time on it. Have to get up to work
in about 3hours. And still need to build a release for this version etc..
<br><br>
If there are any comment or questions dont hesitate to leave that at the bottom at the page.
