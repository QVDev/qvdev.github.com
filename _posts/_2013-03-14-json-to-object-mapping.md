Recently I needed to create object from a JSON response in IOS. After some researching and fooling around 
with some ios libraries. I could not find something simple and easy to use. Most of the libraries are
doing more then just creating objects from the JSON. So I decided too look into on how much trouble it could
be to create this myself. In this post I will explain in detail what I did to make my own Objects from JSON without
using any libraries that take space for stuff you don't need.
